<h2 align="center"> About Me 🙋🏽‍♂️💻 </h2>
<p align="center"> I am a Python programmer with a passion for data science. As a current student, I am constantly seeking new opportunities to learn and grow in my field. 
When I am not coding, you can find me exploring new datasets, analyzing trends, and visualizing data. I am always eager to dive into new projects and challenges, and I believe that my skills in Python and data analysis make me a valuable asset to any team. </p>
